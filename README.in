## Usage

```
pallene.jar \
  --address a \
  --port p \
  --chroot c \
  --file f \
  --group-id g \
  --user-id u \
  --mime-type m
```

The `pallene.jar` command reads the contents of `f` into memory, opens
a socket `s` and binds it to address `a`, port `p`. It then chroots
to directory `c` and switches to group ID `g` and user ID `u`. Then,
for each client connection `k` on `s`, it reads and discards at most
`1024` octets from `k` and then responds with an HTTP `HTTP/1.0 200
OK` response, serving the contents of `f` with MIME type `m`. It then
closes `k`.

The command does NOT fork into the background; it is designed to run
under a process supervision system and simply aborts with exit code
`1` on any error. The command logs the addresses of connecting clients,
but does not log any data or headers the clients send. The command only
works on POSIX-compatible systems.

See the `examples` directory in this source repository for example
scripts that can, for example, run the server in a memory-restricted
Linux `cgroup` and run with GC settings optimized for tiny heaps.
